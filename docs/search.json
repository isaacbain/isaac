You‚Äôll hopefully find lots of interesting content here about environmental data, freshwater ecology, and public health.\nPlease remember, nothing here represents the views of my employer‚Äîit‚Äôs all just my personal work and thoughts. My goal is to make complex data more accessible and even a bit fun. I aim to provide insights and provoke thought rather than deliver definitive conclusions.\nI hope you find something intriguing and valuable on my site.

    "text": "Import data\nLand, Air, Water Aotearoa (LAWA) is a collaboration between New Zealand‚Äôs 16 regional councils and unitary authorities, the Cawthron Institute, the Ministry for the Environment, the Department of Conservation, and Stats NZ.\nIt provides state of the environment monitoring data for a number of environmental domains, including:\n\nswimming water quality,\nestuary health,\ngroundwater quality,\nlake quality,\nland cover,\nriver quality,\nwater quantity,\n\nand of particular interest here, air quality.\nLAWA make their data freely available at https://lawa.org.nz/download-data, from which I downloaded an excel sheet of air quality for the period 2016-2022. They only have PM10 and PM2.5 parameters available for now.\nParticulate matter (PM) can have adverse effects on human health and the environment. The numbers 10 and 2.5 refer to the diameter of the particles in micrometers (¬µm).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the human health impacts of PM in New Zealand?\n\n\n\n\n\nHales et al.¬†(2021) did a retrospective cohort epidemiological study of the association between PM2.5, NO2 and mortality and morbidity for 2.2m New Zealanders. They found that exposure to PM2.5 per 10 Œºg/m3 increased the risk of death by 11% (95% CI 7-15%) and increased the risk of ischaemic heart disease by 29% (95% CI 23-35%).\nHales, S., Atkinson, J., Metcalfe, J., Kuschel, G., & Woodward, A. (2021). Long term exposure to air pollution, mortality and morbidity in New Zealand: cohort study. Science of The Total Environment, 801, 149660.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPM10\n\n\n\nDefinition\nPM10 refers to particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less.\n\n\nSources\nThese particles are usually produced by mechanical processes such as construction activities, road dust, industrial processes, and natural sources like pollen and sea spray.\n\n\nHealth Effects\nPM10 particles can be inhaled into the lungs, causing respiratory issues, aggravating asthma, and other lung diseases. They can also affect cardiovascular health.\n\n\nRegulations\nMany countries have set air quality standards for PM10 to protect public health. For instance, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the 24-hour mean concentration of PM10 should not exceed 45 ¬µg/m¬≥.\n\n\nPM2.5\n\n\n\nDefinition\nPM2.5 refers to particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less.\n\n\nSources\nThese finer particles are often produced by combustion processes such as vehicle emissions, power plants, residential heating, industrial activities, and wildfires. Secondary particles can also form in the atmosphere from chemical reactions involving gases like sulfur dioxide (SO‚ÇÇ) and nitrogen oxides (NOx).\n\n\nHealth Effects\nPM2.5 particles are more dangerous than PM10 because they can penetrate deeper into the respiratory tract, reaching the alveoli in the lungs. Long-term exposure to PM2.5 is associated with increased rates of chronic bronchitis, lung cancer, heart disease, and can also impact cognitive function.\n\n\nRegulations\nWHO guidelines suggest that the annual mean concentration of PM2.5 should not exceed 10 ¬µg/m¬≥, and the 24-hour mean should not exceed 25 ¬µg/m¬≥.\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ndat &lt;- readxl::read_xlsx(\"data/airqualitydownloaddata_2016-2022.xlsx\",\n                         sheet = \"Air Quality Data\") |&gt; \n  clean_names() |&gt; \n  mutate(year = year(sample_date)) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(sample_date) & !is.na(concentration))"

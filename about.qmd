Hi there! I'm a quantitative ecologist who loves working in environmental resource management. I dive into all sorts of tasks, from analysing raw data and generating insights, to developing policies, advising decision-makers, and building tools to help with implementation. I'm all about using open-source tools like R and making sure my analyses are reproducible.

I call Ōtautahi (Christchurch) home—a lovely little city. When I'm not working, you'll likely find me packrafting, paragliding, bikepacking, or sea kayaking.

Most of my work focuses on freshwater ecosystems, but I'm also interested in how our environment health affects human health. I spend a lot of time at the intersection of science and policy, trying to bridge the gap between research and real-world applications.

On top of all that, I'm also a PhD candidate in Public Health at the University of Otago, continuing to learn and contribute to a new field.
